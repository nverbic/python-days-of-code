I got that feeling
That bad feeling that you don't know
I don't even know her
But I hope that
She comforts you tonight
Nobody here that keeps you in the shade
And ever owned you
Some sentimental tears or someone else's girl
That drips away
But I somehow slowly love you
And wanna keep you the same
Well, I somehow slowly know you
And wanna keep you away
